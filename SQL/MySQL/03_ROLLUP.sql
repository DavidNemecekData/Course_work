# exercise 1.1 - Write a query that generates a report on:
# the store's total sales and its employees,
# the store's total sales (no division by employee),
# total sales.
# Additionally â€“ choose your own way to sort rows.

# exercise 2.1 - ROLLUP and HAVING
# determines the sum of payments divided by client and by employee,
# determines the sum of payments per client,
# determines the sum of payments.

# Do two versions of the exercise:
# Using only ROLLUP,
# Adding the HAVING clause to the GROUP BY for payments above 70.
# How are the results of the queries different?
# To make it easier to notice the difference,
# do the exercise only for the first 3 customers (customer_id < 4).
